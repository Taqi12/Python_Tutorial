    "  - a function is a block of \n",
    "    - organized \n",
    "    - reusable code \n",
    "  - that performs a specific task. \n",
    "  - Functions help in \n",
    "    - modularizing code \n",
    "    - making it more readable \n",
    "    - maintainable\n",
    "    - reusable \n",
    "  - Here's the basic structure of a function in Python:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "    \"\"\"docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    # code block\n",
    "    return result \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - `def:` \n",
    "      - Keyword used to define a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `function_name:` \n",
    "      - Name of the function (follows variable naming conventions).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `parameters:` \n",
    "      - Input values or arguments passed to the function (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `\"\"\"docstring\"\"\":` \n",
    "      - Optional documentation string describing the purpose and usage of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `Code block:` \n",
    "      - The actual code that performs the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `return result:` \n",
    "      - Optional statement to return a value from the function\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Types of Functions:`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Built-in Functions:`\n",
    "    - Python provides a variety of built-in functions like print(), len(), sum(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `User-Defined Functions:`\n",
    "    - These are functions created by the user to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Lambda Functions:`\n",
    "    - Also known as `anonymous functions`, created using the lambda keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Recursive Functions:`\n",
    "    - Functions that call themselves.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `Higher-Order Functions:`\n",
    "    - Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Advantages` \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Modularity:`\n",
    "    - Functions promote modularity by allowing you to break down a program into smaller, manageable pieces. Each function can focus on a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Reuse of Code:`\n",
    "    - Functions allow you to reuse code. Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times from different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Readability:`\n",
    "    - Functions enhance the readability of code. Descriptive function names make the code self-documenting, providing a clear understanding of what the function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Easy Debugging:`\n",
    "    - Functions facilitate debugging as you can isolate and test specific parts of your code. This makes it easier to identify and fix errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Abstraction:`\n",
    "    - Functions provide abstraction by hiding the implementation details. Users only need to know what the function does, not how it achieves the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Scoping:`\n",
    "    - Functions introduce variable scoping, limiting the scope of variables to the function they are defined in. This helps avoid naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Parameterization:`\n",
    "    - Functions can be parameterized, allowing you to pass values to them. This makes functions flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Uses of Functions:`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `Task Segmentation:`\n",
    "    - Divide a complex task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, each handled by a separate function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `Code Reusability:`\n",
    "    - Define functions for commonly used operations to avoid duplicating code and promote reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Data Transformation:`\n",
    "    - Implement functions to transform data, perform calculations, or manipulate data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Encapsulation:`\n",
    "    - Encapsulate a set of operations within a function, providing a clear interface to the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Event Handling:`\n",
    "    - Define functions to handle events or actions, making the code modular and responsive to user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Algorithm Implementation:`\n",
    "    - Implement algorithms as functions, making it easier to understand and modify the algorithm independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Testing and Debugging:`\n",
    "    - Isolate specific parts of the code within functions to facilitate testing and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Limitations of Functions:`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - `Overhead:`\n",
    "    - Functions introduce some overhead in terms of memory and performance. Calling functions repeatedly in a loop may impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Scope Confusion:`\n",
    "    - Incorrect scoping can lead to variable name conflicts, making the code hard to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Abstraction Overhead:`\n",
    "    - Excessive use of abstraction may make the code harder to understand for someone unfamiliar with the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Function Naming:`\n",
    "    - Poorly chosen function names can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the function's purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Dependency:`\n",
    "    - Functions can introduce dependencies between different parts of the code. Changes to one function may affect others.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Global State Modification:`\n",
    "    - Modifying global variables within functions can lead to unexpected side effects and may make the code less predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `Debugging Challenges:`\n",
    "    - Debugging can be challenging if functions are overly complex or if there are multiple function calls nested within each other.\n"
