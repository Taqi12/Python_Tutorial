    "- `Definition`\n",
    "  - It involves various operations related to reading from and writing to files.\n",
    "  - Python provides built-in functions and methods to perform these operations efficiently.\n",
    "    - `Opening a file`\n",
    "      - To open a file, you use the built-in open() function. It takes two parameters: the file path and the mode in which you want to open the file (e.g., read mode, write mode, append mode, etc.).\n",
    "    - `Reading from a file`\n",
    "      - After opening a file, you can read its contents using various methods such as read(), readline(), or readlines().\n",
    "    - `Writing to a file`\n",
    "      - You can write data to a file by opening it in write or append mode and using the write() method.\n",
    "    - `Closing a file`\n",
    "      - After performing file operations, it's essential to close the file using the close() method to release system resources.\n",
    "    - `Using context managers (with statement)`\n",
    "      - Python's with statement provides a cleaner way to open and automatically close files using a context manager.\n",
    "    - `Iterating over file content`\n",
    "      - You can iterate over the lines of a file using a for loop, which reads the file line by line.\n",
    "    - `File Modes`\n",
    "      - r: Read mode (default). Opens a file for reading.\n",
    "      - w: Write mode. Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file or truncates the existing file to zero length if it exists.\n",
    "      - a: Append mode. Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file or appends to the existing file if it exists.\n",
    "      - b: Binary mode. Opens a file in binary mode (e.g., 'rb' for reading binary, 'wb' for writing binary).\n",
    "      - +: Update mode. Opens a file for updating (reading and writing).\n",
    "    - `Error Handling`\n",
    "      - It's essential to handle exceptions when working with files using try-except blocks to prevent runtime errors."
